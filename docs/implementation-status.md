# Implementation status

The Figma reference is adapted to Go-rendered HTML and CSS. The browser loads no JavaScript or third-party resources. Product artwork is decorative CSS illustration, not product photography. The original `[OPSECMKT]` wordmark is retained.

## Working application behavior

- Token-protected, transactional first-run administrator setup; repeated setup is rejected.
- Buyer registration, bcrypt password hashing, rotating hashed sessions, session revocation, CSRF validation, bounded forms and authentication concurrency.
- Server-enforced buyer, vendor, moderator, and administrator roles.
- PostgreSQL-backed listing creation, catalog search/category/region filters, product and vendor pages.
- Atomic-unit BTC/XMR price storage; idempotent **unfunded draft** creation and owner-only order access. Draft creation does not reserve stock or collect payment.
- Storage and delivery of locally encrypted armored messages, recipient notifications, and account audit history. Armor is format-checked, not cryptographically authenticated.
- Moderator dispute decisions can be recorded for eligible funded states; this version cannot create funded states or transfer funds.
- Desired node settings are saved for operator review. Deployment remains operator-controlled.
- Docker internal/external database selection, separate clearnet/Tor exposure, optional operator-supplied full-node containers, encrypted database backup and transactional restore scripts.

## Not yet implemented

Payment addresses, wallet custody, deposit monitoring, escrow, refunds, withdrawals, automated digital delivery, actual node/API connectivity, TOTP enrollment/challenge, recovery codes, CAPTCHA, PGP signature/key verification, XMPP delivery, signed canary publication, signed audit export, verified reviews, inventory editing/archiving, and automatic mirror orchestration are not implemented. Related interface states are explicitly unavailable; no mock balances or deposit addresses are presented as real.

Tor deployment isolates inbound exposure. Local full nodes use direct peer-network egress. Selecting external database/RPC services explicitly permits application egress; this is not an all-traffic-through-Tor configuration. Read README before deployment.

This is a functional application foundation and interface, not a completed production cryptocurrency exchange or escrow service.
